# SmartCane_CapstoneUWIEngineering
This is my Capstone project on the Smart cane for the Visually Impaired. 
This project was conducted at the Faculty of Engineering UWI MONA Campus.
The smart cane is a technological device designed to assist in allowing for the visually impaired to easily traverse around their surroundings in the safest way possible. In developing the Smart Cane, it should be able to carry out various objectives, these are:
1. Navigate around obstacles, an example of these obstacles are humans, buildings, vehicles etc.
2. Detect the location of the user using a GPS module providing real time tracking by the user.
3. Provide security alerts with push of an SOS button and also when the user is no longer travelling their regular path.
4. Scan and provide feedback to the user acknowledging the obstacle being detected. 
5. Detect hazards such as fire hazards using a flame sensor.
